# Account setup

An API Key can be considered as a username that is generating to allow access to data.

An API Secret, also referred to as API Private Key is simply a password used in combination with an API Key.

An API Password, also referred to as `Passphrase`, is considered an extra layer of security that is generally user generated. In this instance, you can create an API password to lock the API Key and Secret created on the OKX website. You will only be able to see your API Key and Secret by inputting the password you selected.
