## Partnership details

Binance has 2 accounts requirements to support OctoBot:

* A relatively new account \(after july 1st 2021\)
* No referral code on the account

In case your current account is not meeting these criteria, you can support OctoBot by creating a new account \(without adding any referral id\) on [https://www.binance.com/](https://www.binance.com/).

Please note that thanks to [Internal Transfers](https://www.binance.com/en-NG/support/faq/360037037312), you can move your funds quickly and for free between Binance accounts.
