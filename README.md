# Getting Started

## Partner exchanges - Support OctoBot

As the OctoBot team, **our goal is to keep providing OctoBot for free**. However developing and maintaining the project comes at a cost. Therefore we rely on exchanges partnerships to propose the most convenient way to support OctoBot.

By using OctoBot on real trading with our partner exchanges, you contribute to support the project and it won't cost you any money.

If an account you are using is not meeting a partner exchange requirement, you will see an error message: this doesn't prevent your from using OctoBot. However the OctoBot team would greatly appreciate if you could create a new account that meets the exchange's requirements to support the project.

Here are the current partners:

## Officially supported exchanges

TODO

## Community tested exchanges

TODO

## Exchanges supported technologies

_REST_ : **slow** and **limited** requests

_Websocket_ : **high speed** and **no limit**

If you want use any exchange that is available [here](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Exchange-Markets), the REST interface should work but **it's at your own risk** since we did not test it yet.

For simulated only exchanges, see the \"Simulated exchange\" section below.
