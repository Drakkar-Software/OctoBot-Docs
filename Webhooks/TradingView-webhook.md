    You can find OctoBot's webhook on your OctoBot's configuration
    page or in OctoBot's starting logs. It should be an url like
    <http://XXXXXXXX.ngrok.io/webhook/trading_view>.

    WARNING: To improve performances, webhooks are started only when
    required, this means that **you need to activate a webhook related
    tentacle to get the webhook url** (a tentacle such as the **trading
    view signals trading mode**)

-   Set the alert message to .. code-block:

        EXCHANGE={{exchange}}
        SYMBOL={{ticker}}
        SIGNAL=BUY

    if it's a buy signal

OR

``` bash
EXCHANGE={{exchange}}
SYMBOL={{ticker}}
SIGNAL=SELL
```

if it's a sell signal

You can also use a token to add a security layer on your webhook using
an identification token, this token is randomly generated by your
OctoBot and can be found on the configuration interface and in execution
logs.

To add your token on the tradingview.com signal: add the following line
to the alert message:

``` bash
TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```
