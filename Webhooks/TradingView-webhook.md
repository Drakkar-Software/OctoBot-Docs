    You can find OctoBot's webhook on your OctoBot's configuration
    page or in OctoBot's starting logs. It should be an url like <https://XXXXXXXX.octobot.cloud/webhook/trading_view> or <http://XXXXXXXX.ngrok.io/webhook/trading_view>.

    WARNING: To improve performances, webhooks are started only when
    required, this means that **you need to activate a webhook related
    tentacle to get the webhook url** (a tentacle such as the **trading
    view signals trading mode**)

    [![webhook log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/assets/wiki_resources/webhook_log.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/assets/wiki_resources/webhook_log.jpg)

-   Set the alert message:

``` bash
EXCHANGE={{exchange}}
SYMBOL={{ticker}}
SIGNAL=BUY
```

if it's a buy signal

OR

``` bash
EXCHANGE={{exchange}}
SYMBOL={{ticker}}
SIGNAL=SELL
```

if it's a sell signal

Additional order details can be added to the signal. These are optional:

``` bash
ORDER_TYPE=LIMIT
VOLUME=0.01
PRICE=42000
STOP_PRICE=38000
REDUCE_ONLY=true
```

- `ORDER_TYPE` can be `MARKET` or `LIMIT`
- `VOLUME` is the order volume in the base currency of the pair (BTC for BTC/USDT). When unspecified, order volume is computed from a % of your portfolio available funds. 
- `PRICE` is the price of the limit order in quote asset (USDT for BTC/USDT)
- `STOP_PRICE` is the price of the stop order to create (also requires the `PRICE` to be set to link it with a limit order) 
- `REDUCE_ONLY` is only used for futures trading, it can be `true` or `false`

Example signal:

``` bash
EXCHANGE=binance
SYMBOL=ETHBTC
SIGNAL=SELL
ORDER_TYPE=LIMIT
```

You can also use a token to add a security layer on your webhook using
an identification token, this token is randomly generated by your
OctoBot and can be found on the configuration interface and in execution
logs.

To add your token on the tradingview.com signal: add the following line
to the alert message:

``` bash
TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```
