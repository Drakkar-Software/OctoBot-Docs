OctoBot backesting feature allows to test strategies, trading modes and
technical evaluators by replaying a past scenario.

Backtesting is very useful to quickly test different configurations.

==================

OctoBot has a strategy optimizer feature that uses several backtesting
scenarii to compare different settings of a strategy and a trading mode.

This feature is a fast and easy way to test and compare settings on a
given strategy and trading mode and figure out the best setup without
having to test it on a real time market.
