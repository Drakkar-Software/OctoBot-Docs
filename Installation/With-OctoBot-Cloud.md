With OctoBot cloud
==================


While the full OctoBot is designed to create and customize strategies, the [OctoBot cloud](https://www.octobot.cloud/?utm_source=octobot.info&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=install_with_octobot_cloud&utm_content=intro) makes it very easy to use those strategies.

OctoBot cloud enables you to:
- Follow trading strategies using OctoBot in an unlimited and very simple way **for free**. OctoBot cloud takes care of all the setup and technical parts for you.
- Run your own full OctoBot on the cloud. With a full OctoBot, you can customize or create the trading strategy of your choice. Cloud OctoBots also include exclusive features such as:
  - the [Strategy designer](https://blog.octobot.online/strategy-designer-revamp)
  - integrated webhook for [alerts such as from tradingview.com](https://blog.octobot.online/trading-using-tradingview).
