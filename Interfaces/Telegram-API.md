Telegram API
==================

Telegram service configuration
------------------------------

Create your App
---------------

Before working with Telegramâ€™s API, you need to get your own API ID and hash:

In order to obtain an API id and develop your own application using the Telegram API you need to do the following:

- Sign up for Telegram using any application.
- Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org.
- Go to 'API development tools' and fill out the form.
- You will get basic addresses as well as the **api_id** and **api_hash** parameters required for user authorization.


Configuration
-------------

Add in **user/config.json** in the services key :

``` json
"telegram-api": {
    "telegram-api": "YOUR_API_ID",
    "telegram-api-hash": "YOUR_API_HASH",
    "telegram-phone": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_PHONE_NUMBER"
}
```

### Secure code

At the first OctoBot start with a new `telegram-api` configuration a 2-factor authentication code will be sent to your account.
Just enter it the code in your OctoBot console and press enter.
