Profiles
========

OctoBot\'s trading configuration is using profiles (located into
user/profiles). This allows for quick switches between previously set
configurations.

Profiles include:

-   Tentacles activations
-   Tentacles configurations
-   Traded pairs
-   Enabled exchanges
-   Trading configuration

Login related data (exchange api keys, telegram settings, \...) are not
stored in profiles.

Profiles can also be shared and imported between OctoBot\'s users.
